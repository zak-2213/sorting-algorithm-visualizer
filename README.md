Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

For my Computer Science Internal Assessment, I made a visualizer for sorting algorithms. Sorting algorithms are an important part of our course, and some of these algorithms can be difficult to grasp so I made this to help show how each algorithm works so that you can get a deeper understanding of them.
